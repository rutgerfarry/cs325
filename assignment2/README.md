## Running the code
The script is built in Python 2, so running it should be simple on most computers:
```bash
python sequence_align.py {cost_file} {input_file}
```

Alternatively, you can put the script in the same directory as a cost file named `imp2cost.txt` and an input file named `imp2input.txt` and just run with no arguments:
```bash
python sequence_align.py
```

**Generated output will be placed in:** `./imp2output.txt`
