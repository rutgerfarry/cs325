## Warming-up question: Local temperature change
**Write summary here**

### Running the code
**TODO**
### Linear program description
**TODO**
### Solution
**TODO**
include variables, final equation, and output of GuLP, showing it was an optimal solution
### Plot
**TODO**
- raw data plotted as points in 2-d (with d as the x-axis and T as the y-axis),
- best fit curve, and
- linear part of the curve x0 + x1 Â· d.
### Reflection
**TODO**
Discuss whether or not Corvallis' temperature is rising (per day and per century) and whether these findings fit with other climate models
